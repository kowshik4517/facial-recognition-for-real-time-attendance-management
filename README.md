# facial-recognition-for-real-time-attendance-management
A real-time face recognition-based attendance system using OpenCV, MTCNN, and ResNet50. It captures live webcam input, detects and recognizes faces, and marks attendance automatically. The frontend is built with React.js to display live video, attendance logs, and reports. PHP handles backend operations like data storage and retrieval using JSON. 
# 🎯 Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System

A smart, contactless attendance management system using real-time     face recognition     technology to automate and streamline attendance logging.

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses     OpenCV     to capture live video input,     MTCNN     for accurate face detection, and     ResNet50     for deep learning-based face recognition. The frontend is developed with     React.js     to provide a live, user-friendly dashboard. Backend operations, including attendance storage, reports, and schedules, are handled using     PHP     and     JSON    .
